# DSA

This repository contains assignments from the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) module during my CDAC course. The programs cover essential data structures and algorithms, including sorting techniques, linked lists (LL), stack and queue implementations, binary search, trees, and hashing. Each assignment demonstrates core DSA concepts, focusing on efficient data manipulation and problem-solving techniques.
